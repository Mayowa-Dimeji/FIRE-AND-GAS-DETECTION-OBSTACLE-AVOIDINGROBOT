# FIRE-AND-GAS-DETECTION-OBSTACLE-AVOIDING ROBOT

Purpose: Fire + Gas Detection Robot Obstacle Avoidance Robot
-- How it works: The robot moves around and runs its obstacle avoidance routine. When fire is detected, it stops the car, keeps buzzing until fire 
is gone and resumes its routine. When gas leaks, ring buzzer until gas levels are back to normal. Both routines also send an SMS alert via the Wi-Fi module (simulated by Serial print statements).

There are two versions of this project; macro and register manipulation versions. the register manipukation version was done in an attempt to optimize program.
